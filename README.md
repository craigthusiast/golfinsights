*Golf Insights* is a tool I'm developing to help you improve your golf game.

Track the shots you "miss" and determine which areas of your game need the most improvement.

- Calculates your handicap
- Tracks your game statistics (fairways hit, greens in reg, putts, etc.)
- Tracks your shots/clubs missed (see trends, learn where you need most improvement)
- Charts and graphs
- Works on both desktop and mobile browsers
- Native Mobile app (in the future)

I'm always keen to connect with other golfers and software developers.
